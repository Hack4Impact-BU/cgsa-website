# CGSA Website
This is the GitHub repository for the Fall 2024 CGSA Website project. The BU Hack4Impact team is working to revamp the website of the BU Center for Gender, Sexuality & Activism with the goal of completing the site in early December.

This repository will be updated as development of the project continues. It is currently in an unfinished state.
