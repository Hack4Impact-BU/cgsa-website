# CGSA Website
This is the GitHub repository for the Fall 2024 CGSA Website project. The BU Hack4Impact team worked to revamp the website of the BU Center for Gender, Sexuality & Activism. The website includes native forms and a blog section with an admin page where site admins can view form responses and make blog posts that are also automatically emailed to students in their newsletter. The site was made using React and NodeJS, and uses MongoDB, Netlify, and Heroku for hosting. The project began in late August and ended in late December.
